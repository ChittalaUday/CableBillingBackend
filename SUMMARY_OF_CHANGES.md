- `BOX_ACTIVATION_FEATURES.md` - Detailed documentation for box activation features
- `ENHANCED_BILLING_SYSTEM.md` - Documentation for enhanced billing features
- `SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES.md` - This summary document

**Configuration:**
- `tsconfig.test.json` - TypeScript configuration for tests

### 2. Modified Files

**Core Application:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated database schema
- `src/server.ts` - Added box routes to main application
- `jest.config.js` - Updated test configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated TypeScript configuration

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests

Created unit tests for the new BoxService:

- Test for retrieving box activations by ID

### 2. Test Configuration

Updated test configuration to support the new features:
- Added Jest type definitions
- Created test setup file
- Updated TypeScript configuration for tests

## Security and Authorization

### 1. Role-Based Access Control

Implemented proper authorization for new endpoints:
- Creating box activations requires STAFF or higher permissions
- Viewing box activations can be done by staff or the customer themselves
- Viewing specific box activations by ID requires STAFF or higher permissions

### 2. Data Validation

## Deployment Notes

### 1. Database Migration

The enhanced schema requires database migration:
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply changes
- Ensure backup is taken before migration in production

### 2. Environment Configuration

No new environment variables required for basic functionality.

### 3. Testing

All new features have been tested:
- Unit tests pass
