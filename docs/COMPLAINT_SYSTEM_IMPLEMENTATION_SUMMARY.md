# Complaint System Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the complaint management system for the Cable Management System.

## Overview

The complaint system has been implemented to allow customers to submit complaints and staff members to manage and resolve them. The system supports four specific categories of complaints:

1. **REPAIR** - Issues with existing connections or equipment
2. **NEW_INSTALLATION** - Requests for new cable connections
3. **HOME_VISIT_COLLECTION** - Requests for payment collection at customer's residence
4. **WIRE_CUT** - Reports of damaged or cut cables

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Schema

The existing `Complaint` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` was enhanced with documentation comments to clarify the supported categories.

### 2. Backend API Modules

#### Complaints Service (`src/modules/complaints/complaints.service.ts`)

- Create, read, update, and delete complaints
- Filter and paginate complaints
- Assign complaints to staff members
- Generate complaint statistics
- Proper error handling and logging

#### Complaints Controller (`src/modules/complaints/complaints.controller.ts`)

- RESTful API endpoints for complaint management
- Input validation using Joi schemas
- Proper response formatting
- Error handling

#### Complaints Validation (`src/modules/complaints/complaints.validation.ts`)

- Joi validation schemas for:
  - Creating complaints
  - Updating complaints
  - Complaint ID parameters
  - Customer ID parameters
  - Query parameters for filtering

#### Staff/Admin Routes (`src/modules/complaints/complaints.routes.ts`)

- Protected endpoints requiring staff authentication
- Role-based access control
- Full complaint management capabilities

#### Customer Routes (`src/modules/complaints/complaints.customer.routes.ts`)

- Protected endpoints requiring customer authentication
- Limited to self-service capabilities
- Customers can only access their own complaints

### 3. Database Seeding

#### Complaints Seeder (`src/database/seeds/complaints.seeder.ts`)

- Sample complaint data for testing
- Automatic assignment to existing customers
- Proper cleanup functionality

#### Updated Main Seeder (`src/database/seeds/index.ts`)

- Integration with the main seeding system
- New CLI commands for complaint seeding

### 4. Server Integration

#### Updated Server (`src/server.ts`)

- Registration of complaint routes
- Proper middleware configuration

## API Endpoints

### Staff/Admin Endpoints (`/api/complaints`)

- `POST /` - Create a new complaint
- `GET /` - Get all complaints with filtering and pagination
- `GET /stats` - Get complaint statistics (Manager/Admin only)
- `GET /customer/:customerId` - Get all complaints for a specific customer
- `GET /:id` - Get a specific complaint
- `PUT /:id` - Update a complaint
- `PUT /:id/assign` - Assign a complaint to a staff member
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete a complaint (Admin only)

### Customer Endpoints (`/api/customer/complaints`)

- `POST /` - Create a new complaint (customer can only create for themselves)
- `GET /` - Get all complaints for the authenticated customer
- `GET /:id` - Get a specific complaint (only if it belongs to the customer)

## Authentication and Authorization

- Staff routes require JWT authentication with role-based access control
- Customer routes require customer JWT authentication
- Customers can only access their own complaints
- Staff members can access all complaints based on their roles

## Data Validation

- Comprehensive input validation using Joi
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
- Proper error messages for invalid inputs

## Error Handling

- Centralized error handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Consistent error response format

## Seeding and Testing

- Sample complaint data for development and testing
- CLI commands for seeding and clearing complaints
- Integration with existing seeding system

## Database Migration

The database migration has been prepared but requires the following steps to complete:

1. Ensure PostgreSQL database connectivity
2. Run the migration command: `npm run db:migrate --name complaint_system_init`
3. Seed the sample data: `npm run db:seed complaints`

## Next Steps

1. Complete the database migration when PostgreSQL connectivity is available
2. Test all API endpoints
3. Integrate with frontend applications
4. Monitor for any issues in production

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `src/modules/complaints/complaints.validation.ts`
- `src/modules/complaints/complaints.service.ts`

- `src/modules/complaints/complaints.customer.routes.ts`
- `src/database/seeds/complaints.seeder.ts`
- `COMPLAINT_SYSTEM.md`
- `COMPLAINT_SYSTEM_SETUP.md`
- `COMPLAINT_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified Files

- `src/server.ts` - Added complaint route registration
