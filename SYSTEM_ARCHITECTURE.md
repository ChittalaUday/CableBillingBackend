# System Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the Cable Management System architecture after implementing the enhancements.

## Overview

The Cable Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing cable TV billing, customer service, and set-top box activations. The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Module Architecture

### Core Modules

#### 1. Authentication Service
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- JWT-based token management
- Role-based access control

#### 2. User Management
- Staff member management
- Role assignment and permissions
- User profile management

#### 3. Customer Management
- Customer registration and profile management
- Account status tracking
- Contact information management

#### 4. Billing Management
- Bill generation and tracking
- Payment processing
- Due settlement management
- Transaction logging

#### 5. Box Activation Service
- Set-top box status tracking
- Service action logging
- Customer box status management

#### 6. Reporting Service
- Financial reporting
- Service activity reports
- Performance analytics

## Data Flow

### 1. Customer Registration
```
Client → Customer Management → Database
```

### 2. Bill Generation
```
Staff → Billing Management → 
  Update Customer (next bill date) → 
  Create Bill Record → 
  Create Transaction Record → 
  Database
```

### 3. Payment Processing
```
Client/Staff → Billing Management → 
  Update Bill Status → 
  Create Payment Record → 
  Create Transaction Record → 
  Database
```

### 4. Box Activation
```
Staff → Box Activation Service → 
  Update Customer Box Status → 
  Create Box Activation Record → 
  Create Transaction Record → 
  Database
```
